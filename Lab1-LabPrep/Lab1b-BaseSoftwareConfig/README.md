# Base lab software configuration
This section provides configuration information for the base lab software. The primary focus on this course is to provide instruction on the usage of Ansible NSX Modules to install and configure VMware NSX. Before excercises can begin focusing on NSX Ansible Modules, you must build and configure the base lab. This course does not provide detailed setup instructions for the base lab components, but will provide sufficient configuration details to enable you to replicate the lab environment if you know how to.

__Before proceeding with this section, you should complete lab 1a and have your virtual-physical or physical hosts connected and powered on__

__Note:__ I used pre-existing elements available in my companies service catalog to provision the base topology elements - I did not build them myself. If any needed details are missing from this section, it would be a big help if you could please submit an issue so I can make corrections.
