# Using Ansible with VMware NSX
This training module will focus primarily on hands-on examples and will provide the reader with step-by-step instructions to walk through installation and basic usage the [VMware NSX Modules for Ansible](https://github.com/vmware/nsxansible). Because this is primarily a hands-on course, users should ensure they have access to a lab environment with licensed access to the required software, as detailed in the [Lab Setup](https://github.com/afewell/AnsibleNSX101/tree/master/Lab1-LabPrep). This course does not provide any access to or licensing of any software products.

## Prerequisites
1. Before taking this training, you should have a good technical understanding of VMware NSX. The course will cover automated installation, setup and basic operational configuration and assumes users already understand the related underlying concepts in NSX.
2. While you should have basic familiarity with Linux & Bash, advanced Linux Knowledge is not required. Each lab will provide step-by-step instructions for those less comfortable in the bash shell.
3. Basic Familiarity with Ansible is nice-to-have but not required. If you do not have Ansible experience, the step-by-step instructions should enable you to get through the labs, but highly recommended that you pursue Ansible-specific training if you plan on using these modules beyond this course.
4. Students should have access to a lab environment capable of supporting the software used in the course, as detailed in the [Lab Setup](Lab1-LabPrep/) section.
5. Students need to provide their own licensed access to any software used in this course. This course provides instruction for both Open Source and Commercial Software and provides no licensing or access to any software.

## Getting Started
To Get Started, go to the [Lab Setup ](../Lab1-LabPrep/) section, and then proceed through the labs in order. Once you complete the lab setup, there are no specific dependencies between labs, so feel free to jump into any specific lab - but beware that some technical explanations may be provided in earlier labs that are not repeated in later labs so in general I recommend that you go through the labs in order. 

I hope in time to add more slides and videos to provide more detailed explanations about the technologies used in the labs, but these arent ready yet. Please check back here in the future for updates.
