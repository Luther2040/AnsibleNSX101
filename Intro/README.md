# Using Ansible with VMware NSX
This training module will focus primarily on hands-on examples and will provide the reader with step-by-step instructions to walk through installation and basic usage the [VMware NSX Modules for Ansible](https://github.com/vmware/nsxansible). Because this is primarily a hands-on course, users should ensure they have access to a lab environment with licensed access to the required software, as detailed in [Lab1a](https://github.com/afewell/AnsibleNSX101/tree/master/3-Lab1-LabPrep/Lab1a-TopologyReview).

## Prerequisites
1. Before taking this training, you should have a good technical understanding of VMware NSX. The course will cover automated installation, setup and basic operational configuration and assumes the users already understand the related underlying concepts in NSX.
2. While you should have basic familiarity with Linux & Bash, advanced Linux Knowledge is not required. Each lab will provide step-by-step instructions for those less comfortable in the bash shell.
3. Basic Familiarity with Ansible is nice-to-have but not required. This course assumes no prior Ansible knowledge.
4. Students should have access to a lab environment capable of supporting the software used in the course, as detailed in [Lab1a](https://github.com/afewell/AnsibleNSX101/tree/master/3-Lab1-LabPrep/Lab1a-TopologyReview).
5. Students need to provide their own licensed access to any software used in this course. This course references both Open Source and Commercial Software and provides no licensing or access to any software.

## Getting Started
To Get Started, review the [Lab Reference Materials]() and then proceed to the [Lab Setup ]().

In the future, I hope to add more slides and video to provide an overview of the course, but these arent ready yet. Please check back here for updates.
